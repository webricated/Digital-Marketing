<h1>Chapter 1.2: How to Move Prospects Through the Customer Value Journey</h1>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Now that you understand what the Customer Value Journey is, the next big question is simple:
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>How do you smoothly guide people from one stage to the next?</strong>
  </div>
  <p>
    The answer lies in creating marketing <strong>campaigns</strong> that are designed
    with clear intent. Nothing is left to chance.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Marketing Campaigns: The Engine of Movement</h2>
  <p>
    A marketing campaign exists for one purpose—to move people forward in the journey.
    Whether that means turning awareness into engagement or customers into loyal fans,
    campaigns make progress happen.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>What Exactly Is a Marketing Campaign?</h3>
  <p>
    Every effective campaign has two essential elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A Call to Action (CTA)</strong> – what you want the audience to do</li>
    <li><strong>A Traffic Source</strong> – where those people come from</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556761175-4b46a572b786" alt="Marketing campaign planning" />
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    The call to action depends on the stage you’re targeting:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Read a blog, watch a video, listen to a podcast</li>
    <li><strong>Subscribe:</strong> Download a checklist, webinar, or guide</li>
    <li><strong>Convert / Ascend:</strong> Purchase a product or service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Traffic may come from ads, email, search engines, social media, or even offline channels
    like print or radio.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section highlight">
  <p>
    A campaign is successful only if it moves someone from one specific stage
    to the very next stage.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Why “Intentional” Marketing Matters</h2>
  <p>
    People often move through the Customer Value Journey naturally—even without
    a company planning for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a friend casually recommending a tool can create awareness or even promotion.
    But relying on chance limits growth.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Now compare that with a referral program that rewards users for inviting others.
    In this case, movement through the journey is carefully engineered.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section highlight">
  <p>
    Intentional campaigns give you control over growth by fixing the stages
    where prospects tend to get stuck.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>The #1 Campaign Mistake Businesses Make</h2>
  <p>
    Once companies understand the journey, they often try to do too much—too fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trying to turn a stranger into a promoter with one campaign simply doesn’t work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, effective marketers create focused campaigns that move people one step at a time.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Real-World Campaign Examples</h2>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Case Study 1: Awareness → Engagement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Get people to engage</li>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> Branding video</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic:</strong> Facebook video ads</li>
    <li><strong>CTA:</strong> “Watch this video”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The campaign focused purely on attention and engagement—no selling, no sign-ups.
    Simple focus led to strong results.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Case Study 2: Engagement → Subscribe</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Build an email list</li>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> Helpful blog post</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic:</strong> Organic social media</li>
    <li><strong>CTA:</strong> Email sign-up popup</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This campaign quietly converts engaged readers into subscribers using a clear,
    low-friction call to action.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Case Study 3: Engage → Subscribe → Convert</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> First-time purchase</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic:</strong> Search ads</li>
    <li><strong>CTA:</strong> Limited-time discount</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By offering a first-order incentive, this campaign reduces hesitation
    and accelerates conversion.

<div class="section highlight">
  <p>
    The best campaigns are often the simplest—clear goal, clear message, clear next step.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
    The Customer Value Journey is the foundation of every digital marketing strategy.
    Each campaign should exist to move people forward—nothing more, nothing less.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you continue through this guide, you’ll see how every tactic connects back
    to this journey.
